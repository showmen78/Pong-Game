## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites

1. **Install raylib**:
   - You can download and install raylib from the official website: [raylib](https://www.raylib.com/).
   - Follow the instructions to install raylib for your platform (Windows, Linux, macOS).

2. **Install a C++ compiler**:
   - Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed. If youâ€™re on Linux, you can install `g++`. On Windows, you can use MinGW or Visual Studio.
   

3. **How to Play**:
- Player 1: Use the W (up) and S (down) keys to control the left paddle.
- Player 2: Use the UP ARROW and DOWN ARROW keys to control the right paddle.
- Objective: Use your paddle to hit the ball and prevent it from passing your side of the screen. Try to get the ball past your opponent's paddle to score a point.

## Game Mechanics
**Ball Movement**:
- The ball starts at the center of the screen with an initial velocity.
The ball will bounce off the top and bottom walls, reversing its Y-direction on collision.
- The ball's direction and speed will change when it collides with a paddle. The ball's speed increases after each paddle collision.
Scoring:

- Player 1: Scores a point when the ball crosses the right side of the screen.
- Player 2: Scores a point when the ball crosses the left side of the screen.
After scoring, the ball resets to the center with a randomized direction.
Ball Collisions:

**Paddle Collision:**
- If the ball hits the paddle, the ball bounces off and speeds up.
Wall Collision: The ball bounces off the top and bottom walls.
